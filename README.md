# GRIDSOME E-COMMERCE EXAMPLE SITE

This is an example E-Commerce JAMStack static website showcasing performance built using Storyblok, Gridsome and TailwindCSS. You can find the article on Sitepoint.com.

The live version of this project can be found [here](https://gridsome-headphones.netlify.app/). Clone or Fork-Clone the project to your hard-drive then execute the following instructions in order.

## Run Local Build

This project accesses data from SitePoint's StoryBlok account. A public read-only API key is configured at `gridsome.config.js`. Run the following commands to get the demo up and running quickly.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
$ npm run develop # or yarn dev
```

If you would like to manipulate data, you will need a Storyblok account. Simply go through the following instructions, Step 1 - 3:

## 1. Using your own StoryBlok Account

1. [Register](https://app.storyblok.com/#!/signup) at Storyblok for free.
2. Create a new Space and copy the preview token from Dashboard > Settings > API Keys pages
3. Create an `.env` file and save the token key-value as : `STORYBLOK_API=<token>`
4. In `gridsome.config.js`, look for and replace the value for `accessToken` to `process.env.STORYBLOK_API,` within the `gridsome-source-storyblok` plugin configuration section.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and for the whole Setup you can have a look at [our step by step guide for Gatsby and Storyblok](**https://www.storyblok.com/tp/gatsby-multilanguage-website-tutorial**)

## 2. Import Necessary components

You can import the example components through the file `seed.components.json` with the [Storyblok CLI](https://github.com/storyblok/storyblok#push-components). For this you will need your space ID, which you can find in your space **settings**.

First you need to install the Storyblok CLI

```bash
# Install Storyblok CLI if you have not already
npm install -g storyblok # or yarn global add storyblok
```

Then you can push the existing `seed.components.json` structure to Storyblok.

```bash
# how to use
storyblok push-components <SOURCE> --space <SPACE_ID>

# example
storyblok push-components ./seed.components.json --space 12345
```

After the import you will have all the components under `Components` in your left sidebar.

## 3. Create Content

Feel free to create content any way you like. Unfortunately, the navbar menu links are hard-coded. Here's a quick guide you can follow:

1. Home Page(`/home` or `/`): delete all existing components. Add `PageTitle` and `ProductList` components. Fill in the fields accordingly
2. Create Products(`/products`) folder with type Product
3. Inside the Product folder, create multiple products. Make sure to fill in all the fields
4. Create About (`/about`) page. Add `PageTitle` and `PageContent` components.
5. Create Contact(`/contact`) page. Add `PageTitle` and `ContactForm`.

Make sure to hit publish otherwise the content won't be visible on production builds.
